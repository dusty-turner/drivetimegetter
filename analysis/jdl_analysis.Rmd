```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(here)
```

* Import the source data
* change dates to eastern
* filter data
* calculate day of week and time

```{r import, message=FALSE}
drive_times <- read_csv(here("drive_times.csv"), col_names = FALSE)
names(drive_times) <-
  c("run_name",
    "from",
    "to",
    "run_date",
    "Time",
    "Distance",
    "Status")

drive_times %>%
  mutate(run_time_eastern = with_tz(force_tz(run_date, "GMT"),  "America/New_York")) %>%
  filter(run_name == "JD") %>%
  mutate(
    day = fct_inorder(weekdays(run_time_eastern),
                      factor(
                        c(
                          "Sunday",
                          "Monday",
                          "Tuesday",
                          "Wednesday",
                          "Thursday",
                          "Friday",
                          "Saturday"
                        )
                      )),
    time = hour(run_time_eastern) + minute(run_time_eastern) / 60,
    drive_min = Time / 60
  ) ->
  drive_times_localized

```

Now we have the drive time localized let's plot


```{r plotting}
drive_times_localized %>%
  filter(!day %in% c("Saturday","Sunday"), 
         to == "11600+Gayton+Rd,+Richmond,+VA+23238", 
         time > 7 & time < 8) ->
  weekday_times


p <- ggplot(weekday_times, aes(x = day, y = drive_min, fill = from)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour="black") +
  labs(title = "Drive time to Steward by week day",
       x = "",
       y = "Drive (minutes)")

p

```

Run from `r date(min(weekday_times$run_time_eastern))` to `r date(max(weekday_times$run_time_eastern))`.
